Confession.  This project scared the C-R-A-P out of me.  Back at the start of winter, I was so frustrated with coding and Nokogiri in particular.  I had no idea how to scrape websites or how I was even going to complete this project.  It honestly felt like something that was so far out of reach and I didn't think I would ever get to where I am now.  I remember thinking, "How in the actual heck am I supposed to build something out of nothing??" There was nothing more intimidating in my mind than staring at a blank cli in sandbox with no tests, folders or files.  

So, let me go ahead and share a few tips on how to complete this project.  Trust me, if I can do it, you can ABSOLUTELY do it too!! Don't give up!!!

Tip #1: Do NOT Be Afraid to Go Back and Review Previous Lessons

The first time I attempted my project, I was not ready.  Period.  I breezed through the lessons and did not truly understand the concepts.  Understanding classes and objects is key for this project.  If you do not understand, go back and review.  Trust me, it's so much better to take a few days or even weeks if necessary to make sure you really understand what is going on with your code.  I also needed to spend a couple of days on Nokogiri because scraping a website was so foreign to me.  But once I reviewed and took the necessary time to understand, that made my life sooo much easier!  Remember, we're doing this coding school to learn.  Take the time to nail down the concepts!  

Tip #2: Watch the Videos, Make Sure the Website is Scrapable & Use Slack

Before I even started my project, I watched all the videos on how to create a CLI step by step.  That was probably one of my biggest intimidation factors- setting up my bin, lib, and gemfiles.  I had no clue where to start!  I didn't really understand how to use Github either since I've been using Learn IDE for all of the labs.  But that's where the videos come in.  Flatiron provides all the info you need if you just watch the videos!  You can always google too of course!  I thought the videos did an excellent job of walking me through everything I needed to set me up for success.  While I was watching these videos and reading up on other people's CLI project experiences, a common theme seemed to be to make sure the website is scrapable before you even begin the project!  I definitely did not want to have to start my project over, so I read that you want to make sure the website does not have a lot of JavaScript in it and that the items you need from the website are in re-occuring classes.  I'm sure there are other things you need to look out for as well, but that's all I really focused on and found my website after looking at the third cite.  

One last thing, I still was a little unsure if my website was good for scraping, so I reached out to the Slack community.  Join the CLI Data Gem Project on Slack and you will not be sorry.  Everyone in this community is so down-to-earth and nice.  They truly want you to succeed!  You get pretty quick responses too and everyone on there is in the same boat as you.  It's nice to have that "We're in this together" mentallity.   

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Once you get started on your project, remember to take breaks when you need to and take it one step at a time!  Keep asking yourself "What do I want this line of code to do?".  Too often I found myself trying to do a million things at once and that was not smart.  Do things one step at a time.  It's okay if it takes a whole day or week(s) to get your code running.  This is your first project your building from scratch, remember?  Cut yourself some slack and give yourself some grace.  Before you know it, your code will be doing what you want it to do and you'll be prepping for a mock technical interview :)  Good luck and happy coding!
