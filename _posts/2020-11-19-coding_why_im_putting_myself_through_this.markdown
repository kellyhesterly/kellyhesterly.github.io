I suppose it all started during my undergrad at Brigham Young University.  I was in the Global Supply Chain program and one of the requirements to complete the curriculum was to take a basic 101 coding course.  It was in that class I was exposed briefly to HTML, CSS, SQL and VBA for excel.  By far my favorite part of the class was creating my very own website.  The requirements for this project was to include a "resume", have a few graphs of some kind, and a brief introduction about ourselves.  

This project was HARD, especially never having done any sort of coding in my life!  I was so unbelievably frustrated at times.  Why wasn't my code working?? Oh, I forgot to include a freakin period, that's why.  What now, what did I do wrong this time?!? Oh I see, that piece of code clearly didn't do what I wanted it to do... and on and on it went.  

But after hours and hours of trial and error (and maybe fighting through a few tears), I completed this project!!  Truly, I was so proud with how it turned out.  In fact, to this day I'm still proud of it and don't mind sharing it here:

Go ahead and scoff, but mind you this was created by a woman who had z-e-r-o experience of coding a few weeks prior to creating it.

So anyways, I graduate from BYU with a job offer from Amazon and didn't give coding another thought.  My husband and I moved to New York City in the Upper West Side so he could begin his schooling at Columbia Law.  I started my career at Amazon in New Jersey (a 1 1/2 hour commute one-way) and quickly learned that the commute and the hours that were demanded of the job were unfortunately not going to work for me.  It was costing me more than it was worth just commuting to and from work (personal car (which, by the way do not own one if you live in NYC!!!!)), gas, & tolls).

Anyways, it was the week I ended my job at Amazon that I found out I was pregnant!  Hahah life ya know?  I quickly found the first job I could, and before you knew it, I was a receptionist for a hedge fund in mid-town.  

Not exactly glamorous, but the pay was actually pretty dang good and so were the benefits.  But geez... I was not fufilled in the slightest.  I answered phone calls, scheduled meetings and ordered lunches for the firm, and that about summed up my day- every day, day in and day out.  I started feeling embarassed when people asked me what I did for work and was kicking myself for going to school for four years only to have become a receptionist.  I was very, very discouraged with my "career" path.     

Fast forward 9 months and I had my beautiful baby boy, received excellent maternity leave, and was promoted to an administrative assistant while away.  When I came back to work, I thought for sure I would have more responsibilities and find more fufillment with my job.  The sad truth is I actually had more work as a receptionist. 

I had many conversations with my husband about how unsastified I was with work.  I also shared how discouraged I was with trying to get back into business management.  Since having my baby, I often thought how wonderful it would be to try and find a career that would allow me to have a better work, life, balance.  My husband would often bring up my brother-in-law who is a computer programmer.  He is able to control his work hours, receives incredible pay, and works from home often.  All of this of course sounded real good to me, but I was hesitant to take the plunge.  Did I want to go back to school?  Did I really want to become a coder?  Could I make it work with both my husband and myself in school, all the while being a parent?    

I knew learning to code would be tough, but it also was the kind of fufillment that I have been craving.  My website I built, although challenging, was incredibly satsifying to me.  Not to mention, coders are needed and in very high demand right now!  Everything about coding checks the box for me.   

Due to COVID, myself and several other administrative assistants were let go during the first round of cuts.  But honestly, this has worked out for the best.  I can now devote a lot of my time to coding, well, as much as my son will allow (which if you're a parent, you know that can be very, very challenging).
