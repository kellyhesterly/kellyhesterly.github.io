After having the CLI project completed, I have gained a lot more confidence in my capabilites and I was actually excited to begin the Sinatra project.  

My husband gave me the idea to create a New York restaurant recommendation app.  Basically a very watered down version of Yelp haha!  I had a lot of fun making this website.  Honestly the logic wasn't so hard to implement because Flatiron School does an excellent job preparing their students with previous labs.  For me, the hardest part was creating the aesthetics for my website.  This project has helped strengthen my css knowledge, which was pretty limited to begin with.  Overall though, I am very pleased with how my website turned out.  It's not perfect by any means, but compared to where I was a few months ago, I am proud of it!
